# spanish_culture
“Cultura și Civilizație Spaniolă” (Eng: “Spanish Culture and Civilization”)  is the website I created as part of the Certificate of Occupational Proficiency in Computer Science.
It was coded in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Unfortunately, the language of the website is Romanian, but I'm currently working on translating its content and adding an EN/RO language button in the upper corner.
